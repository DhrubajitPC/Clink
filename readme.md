This is a demo android app developed with react-native.

The idea of the app is to be able to connect with people easily you end up meeting at conferences.

It is very easy to sign up. Just log in using facebook and you will be given your own QR code.
Other users of the app can just scan your qr code and add u as a connection. This minimizes random connections as you need to interact physically with the person.

The entire purpose is to get rid of traditional business cards as they tend to get lost.

Some npm packages used in the demo:

firebase
native-base
react-native-camera
react-native-facebook-login
react-native-qrcode
react-native-router-flux
react-redux
redux
tcomb-form-native

Usage:

To get started,
1) `cd` into the repo
2) run `npm install`
3) open an android simulator in the pc or connect your phone
4) run `react-native run-android`
